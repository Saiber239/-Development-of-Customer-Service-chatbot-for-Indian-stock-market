A much larger down candle shows more strength than if the down candle is only slightly larger than the up candle.\n The pattern is also more reliable when it follows a clean move higher.

         "responses": ["A bullish engulfing pattern is not to be interpreted as simply a white candlestick, representing upward price movement, following a black candlestick, representing downward price movement. For a bullish engulfing pattern to form, the stock must open at a lower price on Day 2 than it closed at on Day 1. If the price did not gap down, the body of the white candlestick would not have a chance to engulf the body of the previous day's black candlestick.\n Because the stock both opens lower than it closed on Day 1 and closes higher than it opened on Day 1, the white candlestick in a bullish engulfing pattern represents a day in which bears controlled the price of the stock in the morning only to have bulls decisively take over by the end of the day.\n The white candlestick of a bullish engulfing pattern typically has a small upper wick, if any. That means the stock closed at or near its highest price, suggesting that the day ended while the price was still surging upward.\n For more info: https://www.dailyfx.com/education/candlestick-patterns/bullish-engulfing.html"],

The first thing you should have in order when it comes to investing is your ultimate financial goals. For most Americans, this principally includes retirement, along with vacations, buying a home and more. By defining your goals, you can make investment decisions based on them.\n Once you know your goals and their timeline, you can build your portfolio's asset allocation. This involves choosing the selection of investments within your portfolio and what percentages they'll hold. For instance, someone nearing retirement may want to steer clear of individual stocks since they can be quite volatile. Angling towards investments like ETFs and bonds might instead be in order.\n On the other hand, if you're still far from retiring, you might want to take a chance on individual stocks. Their volatility and high-risk nature makes their return potential also much stronger. Since it'll be a while until you retire, you can risk a bit for those earnings.\n As your portfolio ages, you shouldn't just leave it completely alone. Instead, you'll want to rebalance your investments. This entails bringing your portfolio's complexing back to your intended asset allocation. The necessity from this is derived from returns affecting your portfolio over time.\n In the end, there is no way to ensure gains in the investment market. All you can do is maintain strong investment tendencies and make prudent decisions. In addition, try to avoid trading on emotion, as that can lead you down a dangerous path.\n For more info: https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/bull-vs-bear-market/"],

Depending on the trader's appetite for risk, a stop-loss order could be placed above either the high of the harami candle or above the long white candle. Areas of support and resistance might be used to set a profit target.\n Indicators: Traders can use technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastic oscillator with a bearish harami to increase the chance of a successful trade. A short position could be opened when the pattern forms and the indicator gives an overbought signal. Because it is best to trade a bearish harami in an overall downtrend, it may be beneficial to make the indicator's setting more sensitive so that it registers an overbought reading during a retracement in that trend. Profits could be taken when the indicator moves back into oversold territory. Traders who want a larger profit target could use the same indicator on a larger time frame.

A candlestick chart typically represents the price data of stock on a single day, including opening price, closing price, high price, and low price.\n Investors looking to identify harami patterns must first look for daily market performance reported in candlestick charts. Harami patterns emerge over two or more days of trading, and a bullish harami relies on initial candles to indicate that a downward price trend is continuing, and that a bearish market looks to be pushing the price lower.\n The bullish harami indicator is charted as a long candlestick followed by a smaller body, referred to as a doji, that is completely contained within the vertical range of the previous body. To some, a line drawn around this pattern resembles a pregnant woman. The word harami comes from an old Japanese word meaning pregnant.\n For a bullish harami to appear, a smaller body on the subsequent doji will close higher within the body of the previous day's candle, signaling a greater likelihood that a reversal will occur.\n For more info: https://www.dailyfx.com/education/candlestick-patterns/bullish-harami.html"],

Traders may experience excess slippage and enter a false breakout using an aggressive entry.\n Alternatively, wait for the price to close above the upper trend line of the handle, subsequently place a limit order slightly below the pattern's breakout level, attempting to get an execution if the price retraces. There is a risk of missing the trade if the price continues to advance and does not pull back.\n A profit target is determined by measuring the distance between the bottom of the cup and the pattern's breakout level and extending that distance upward from the breakout. For example, if the distance between the bottom of the cup and handle breakout level is 20 points, a profit target is placed 20 points above the pattern's handle.

While one month to one year is the typical timeframe for a cup and handle to form, it can also happen quite quickly or take several years to establish itself, making it ambiguous in some cases.\n Another issue has to do with the depth of the cup part of the formation.
